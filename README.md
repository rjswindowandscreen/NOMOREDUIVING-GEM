## Features

### 1. **Ackermann Steering**

- A custom vehicle model built with realistic Ackermann steering dynamics for accurate maneuverability.

### 2. **ROS2 Communication**

- All sensor data and control signals are fully integrated into the ROS2 ecosystem for seamless interoperability.

### 3. **Sensors**

- **IMU**: Provides orientation and angular velocity.
- **Odometry**: Ensures accurate vehicle state feedback.
- **LiDAR**: Mounted for obstacle detection and environmental scanning. Supports 3D point cloud generation for advanced perception tasks.
- **Cameras**:

  - Front-facing

  <!-- - Rear-facing
  - Left-side
  - Right-side -->

  <!-- > **Note:** By default, only the front camera is bridged to ROS 2.If you want to use all cameras (left, right, rear) in ROS 2,remove the `#` at the beginning of the relevant camera sections in `saye_bringup/config/ros_gz_bridge.yaml` to activate them  (e.g., `/camera/left_raw`, `/camera/right_raw`, `/camera/rear_raw`). -->

<!-- ### 4. **Navigation**

- Integrated with the **Nav2 stack** for autonomous navigation.
- **AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization)** for improved positional accuracy.
- **SLAM** techniques implemented for real-time mapping and understanding of the environment.
- Fine-tuned parameters for optimized navigation performance.

### 5. **Manual Control (with external joystick)**

- Added support for joystick-based manual control in the simulation environment, enabling users to test vehicle movement interactively. -->

### 4. **Visualization**

- Full model and sensor data visualization in **RViz2**, providing insights into robot states and environmental feedback.

## Requirements

- **ROS2 (Humble)**
- **Gazebo Sim Ignition Fortress**
- **RViz2**
- **ROS2_CONTROL**

## Local Installation

### 0. Make sure you have Gazebo Ignition and ROS–Gazebo integration (`ros_gz`) installed for ROS 2 Humble:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-ros-gz
  sudo apt-get install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-gz-ros2-control
  ```

   More details about installing Gazebo and ROS:  [Link](https://gazebosim.org/docs/latest/ros_installation/)

### 1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p gem_sim/src
  cd gem_sim/src
  git clone https://github.com/UIUC-Robotics/gem_simulator.git
  cd ..
  ```
### 2. Build the project:
  ```bash
  colcon build --symlink-install && source install/setup.bash
  ```

## Usage

### 1. Basic Simulation and Manual Control

  ####  Launch the simulation:
  ```bash
     ros2 launch gem_launch gem_init.launch.py
  
     # launch with parameters
     ros2 launch gem_launch gem_init.launch.py x:=0 y:=0 yaw:=-0.5 world_name:=sonoma_raceway.world
 ```
  ####  Control car:
  ```bash
     # in different terminal
     ros2 topic pub -r 10 /ackermann_cmd ackermann_msgs/msg/AckermannDrive \
     "{steering_angle: 0.35, steering_angle_velocity: 0.5, speed: 1.0, acceleration: 0.5}"
  
     # or for Teleop cmds
     source install/setup.zsh
     ros2 launch gem_launch gem_drive.launch.py max_speed:=6.0
  ```

<!-- ### 2. SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

-   To run SLAM Toolbox for mapping, launch the following after starting the simulation:
    ```bash
      ros2 launch saye_bringup slam.launch.py
    ```

### 3. Navigation with Nav2

-   To run the simulation with the Nav2 stack for autonomous navigation, launch the following after starting the simulation:
    ```bash
      ros2 launch saye_bringup navigation_bringup.launch.py
    ```

## Future Work

1. **3D SLAM Support:**
   - Train the vehicle to handle complex scenarios autonomously using advanced DRL algorithms.
2. **Enhanced Features:**
   - Explore additional sensor configurations and navigation strategies.
3. **Nav2 entegration with 3D Localization**
   - İnstead of AMCL(2D), More accurate and robust algorithms implementation.
